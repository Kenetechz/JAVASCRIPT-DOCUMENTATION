          JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your
          website. This happens in games, in the behavior of responses when
          buttons are pressed or with data entry on forms; with dynamic styling;
          with animation, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript is versatile and beginner-friendly. With more experience,
          you'll be able to create games, animated 2D and 3D graphics,
          comprehensive database-driven apps, and much more! JavaScript can
          change the way the webpage (DOM) looks.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language
          used to make webpages interactive (e.g., having complex animations,
          clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.).

          <p>
            JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally
            different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but
            does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
            JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions
            and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was
            renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
          </p>
          <p>
            In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
            declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small
            number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string
            values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the
            more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model
            provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary
            for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without
            any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of
            objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
          </p>
          <p>
            JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not
            have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have
            to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or
            protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables,
            parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Java is a class-based programming language designed for fast
            execution and type safety. Type safety means, for instance, that you
            can't cast a Java integer into an object reference or access private
            memory by corrupting the Java bytecode. Java's class-based model
            means that programs consist exclusively of classes and their
            methods. Java's class inheritance and strong typing generally
            require tightly coupled object hierarchies. These requirements make
            Java programming more complex than JavaScript programming.

            JavaScript borrows most of its syntax from Java, C, and C++, but it
            has also been influenced by Awk, Perl, and Python.
          </p>
          <p>
            JavaScript is case-sensitive and uses the Unicode character set. For
            example, the word Früh (which means "early" in German) could be used
            as a variable name.
          </p>
          <code>const Früh = "foobar";</code>
          <p>
            But, the variable früh is not the same as Früh because JavaScript is
            case sensitive.
          </p>
          <p>
            In JavaScript, instructions are called statements and are separated
            by semicolons (;).
          </p>
          <p>
            A semicolon is not necessary after a statement if it is written on
            its own line. But if more than one statement on a line is desired,
            then they must be separated by semicolons.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is considered best practice, however, to always write a semicolon
            after a statement, even when it is not strictly needed. This
            practice reduces the chances of bugs getting into the code. The
            source text of JavaScript script gets scanned from left to right,
            and is converted into a sequence of input elements which are tokens,
            control characters, line terminators, comments, or whitespace.
            (Spaces, tabs, and newline characters are considered whitespace.)
          </p>

      <section class="main-section" id="comments">
        <header>COMMENTS</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            The syntax of comments is the same as in C++ and in many other
            languages:
          </p>
          <code
            >// a one line comment /* this is a longer, * multi-line comment */
          </code>
          <p>
            You can't nest block comments. This often happens when you
            accidentally include a */ sequence in your comment, which will
            terminate the comment.
          </p>
          <code>/* You can't, however, /* nest comments */ SyntaxError */</code>
          <p>
            In this case, you need to break up the */ pattern. For example, by
            inserting a backslash:
          </p>
          <code>/* You can /* nest comments *\/ by escaping slashes */</code>

        <header>VARIABLES</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application.
            The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain
            rules.
          </p>
          <p>
            A JavaScript identifier usually starts with a letter, underscore
            (_), or dollar sign ($). Subsequent characters can also be digits (0
            – 9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the
            characters A through Z (uppercase) as well as a through z
            (lowercase).
          </p>
          <p>
            You can use most of ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in
            identifiers. (For more details, see this blog post or the lexical
            grammar reference.) You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as
            characters in identifiers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, $credit, and
            _name.

        <header>DECLARING VARIABLES</header>
        <article>
          <p>You can declare a variable in two ways:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              With the keyword var. For example, <span>var x = 42.</span> This
              syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables,
              depending on the execution context.
            </li>
            <li>
              With the keyword const or let. For example, let y = 13. This
              syntax can be used to declare a block-scope local variable. (See
              Variable scope below.)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You can declare variables to unpack values using the destructuring
            assignment syntax. For example,
            <span>const { bar } = foo.</span> This will create a variable named
            bar and assign to it the value corresponding to the key of the same
            name from our object foo.
          </p>
          <p>
            Variables should always be declared before they are used. JavaScript
            used to allow assigning to undeclared variables, which creates an
            undeclared global variable. This is an error in strict mode and
            should be avoided altogether.

        <header>DECLARATION AND INITIALIZATION</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            In a statement like let <span>x = 42,</span> the let x part is
            called a declaration, and the = 42 part is called an initializer.
            The declaration allows the variable to be accessed later in code
            without throwing a ReferenceError, while the initializer assigns a
            value to the variable. In var and let declarations, the initializer
            is optional. If a variable is declared without an initializer, it is
            assigned the value undefined.
          </p>
          <code>let x; console.log(x); // logs "undefined"</code>
          <p>
            In essence, <span>let x = 42</span> is equivalent to
            <span>let x; x = 42.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>const</span> declarations always need an initializer, because
            they forbid any kind of assignment after declaration, and implicitly
            initializing it with undefined is likely a programmer mistake.
          </p>
          <code
            >const x; // SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const
            declaration</code

      <section class="main-section" id="variablescope">
        <header>VARIABLE SCOPE</header>
        <article>
          <p>A variable may belong to one of the following scopes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Global scope: The default scope for all code running in script
              mode.
            </li>
            <li>Module scope: The scope for code running in module mode.</li>
            <li>Function scope: The scope created with a function.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In addition, variables declared with let or const can belong to an
            additional scope:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Block scope: The scope created with a pair of curly braces (a
              block).
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a
            global variable, because it is available to any other code in the
            current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it
            is called a local variable, because it is available only within that
            function.
          </p>
          <p>
            let and const declarations can also be scoped to the block statement
            that they are declared in.
          </p>
          <code
            >if (Math.random() > 0.5) { const y = 5; } console.log(y); //
            ReferenceError: y is not defined</code
          >
          <p>
            However, variables created with var are not block-scoped, but only
            local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides
            within.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, the following code will log 5, because the scope of x
            is the global context (or the function context if the code is part
            of a function). The scope of x is not limited to the immediate if
            statement block.
          </p>

        <header>VARIABLE HOISTING</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            var-declared variables are hoisted, meaning you can refer to the
            variable anywhere in its scope, even if its declaration isn't
            reached yet. You can see var declarations as being "lifted" to the
            top of its function or global scope. However, if you access a
            variable before it's declared, the value is always undefined,
            because only its declaration is hoisted, but not its initialization.
          </p>
          <code
            >console.log(x === undefined); // true var x = 3; (function () {
            console.log(x); // undefined var x = "local value"; })();</code
          >
          <p>The above examples will be interpreted the same as:</p>
          <code
            >var x; console.log(x === undefined); // true x = 3; (function () {
            var x; console.log(x); // undefined x = "local value"; })();
          </code>
          <p>
            Because of hoisting, all var statements in a function should be
            placed as near to the top of the function as possible. This best
            practice increases the clarity of the code.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether let and const are hoisted is a matter of definition debate.
            Referencing the variable in the block before the variable
            declaration always results in a ReferenceError, because the variable
            is in a "temporal dead zone" from the start of the block until the
            declaration is processed.
          </p>
          <code
            >console.log(x); // ReferenceError const x = 3; console.log(y); //
            ReferenceError let y = 3;</code
          >
          <p>
            Unlike var declarations, which only hoist the declaration but not
            its value, function declarations are hoisted entirely — you can
            safely call the function anywhere in its scope.

          <p>Global variables are in fact properties of the global object.</p>
          <p>
            In web pages, the global object is window, so you can set and access
            global variables using the window.variable syntax. In all
            environments, you can use the globalThis variable (which itself is a
            global variable) to access global variables.
          </p>
          <p>
            Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window
            or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or
            frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is
            declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an
            iframe as parent.phoneNumber.
